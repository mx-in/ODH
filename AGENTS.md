# Agent guide

## Current task

_No active task._

<!--
Template while a task is active (replace the line above):

**Task:** task-NNN-short-name: one-line goal
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Agent:** who is working on it

- [x] Feature 1: done (commit abc1234)
- [ ] **▶ IN PROGRESS** Feature 2: what is being built
    - [x] Sub-task 2.1
    - [ ] Sub-task 2.2 (next step: …)
- [ ] Feature 3: not started

**Notes for the next agent:** state that isn't in the code yet (half-made decisions, blockers, files touched but not committed).

ODH is a Chrome (Manifest V3) extension for looking up words and adding them to Anki. Its source is in `src/`, and its tests are in `tests/`.

## Design docs

- [Selection Popup App — Technical Design](docs/tec-design.md): the planned macOS selection bar (Swift host, TypeScript/JavaScript plugins), with ODH as its first plugin. Read it before working on that app or on code shared with it.
- [Task backlog](docs/tasks.md): the design split into tasks, features and sub-tasks. Start the next task from here.
- Extension background and development notes: [doc/](doc/).

## Checks

Run these before every commit:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run test:contracts
npm run test:unit
```

## Task breakdown rules

Split work by the single-responsibility principle: every item has exactly one reason to change.

- **Task = one goal** with one acceptance gate (for the selection app, one milestone). Planned tasks live in [docs/tasks.md](docs/tasks.md).
- **Feature = one component or concern**, such as the gate, the text retriever or the host's `http` namespace. If its name needs "and" to describe two separate things, split it.
- **Sub-task = one behaviour you can verify on its own**, finished in one sitting and small enough for one commit. Write it as a verb plus an object ("Reject secure text fields"), not as an area ("security").
- **Keep layers apart:** contract, platform code and UI are separate sub-tasks, even inside one feature, so each changes for one reason only.
- **Open decisions are their own items**, placed before the code that depends on them.
- **Verification is its own item**, at the end of the feature or task it checks.
- If a sub-task turns out to need two commits, split it in the checklist before continuing.

## Task tracking rules

Every task keeps its checklist in **Current task** at the top of this file, so another agent can take over after an interruption.

1. **Start:** before writing code, replace `_No active task._` with the task name, the start date, and a checklist that splits the task into features, with sub-tasks under each. Number tasks in order: `task-001-…`, `task-002-…`. Use the next number after the highest one in `docs/archive/`.
2. **Mark what is being worked on:** exactly one item carries `**▶ IN PROGRESS**`. Move the marker before starting the next item, not after.
3. **Keep it current:** tick an item as soon as it is done, and add its commit hash to finished features. Add sub-tasks you discover along the way. Write anything the next agent needs to know under **Notes for the next agent**.
4. **Resume first:** an agent that finds an active task continues from the in-progress item and reads the notes before doing anything else. It does not start a new task until the current one is finished or the user drops it.
5. **Finish:** when every item is ticked, copy the whole section (checklist, commit hashes, notes) into `docs/archive/task-NNN-short-name-archive.md`. Add a finished date and a short summary of the outcome. Then reset **Current task** to `_No active task._` and commit both files in one `docs(archive): …` commit. The archive is the working history; never edit an archived file afterwards.

## Commit rules

- **One feature per unit of work.** Split a task into separate features (a fix, a refactor, a capability, a doc) and finish them one at a time. Don't mix unrelated changes in a single change set.
- **Commit as soon as a feature is complete.** When one feature is done and the checks pass, commit it before starting the next. Never batch several features into one commit, and never leave finished work uncommitted.
- **Each commit stands alone.** It builds, passes the checks, and contains only the files for that feature.
- **Message format:** Conventional Commits, `type(scope): summary`, in the imperative and lower case. For example, `fix(anki): read the connection state live instead of replaying a snapshot`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`.
- Add a body when the reason isn't obvious from the summary.
